How to call microservices
Rest template example watch 146. step 17

Access this app using http://localhost:8100/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
make sure other currency exchange service is up..


feign is kind of replacement of rest template basically to communicate with 100 microservices as we have
to repeat the code

Feign also help us to do loadbalancing

problem with current architencture is feign only handles right now port 8000,
if a 800 service goes down it won't be working so to avoid that we have Naming Server or service registry
